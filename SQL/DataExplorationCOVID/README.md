# COVID-19 Data Exploration (SQL Project)

## Project Background
This project explores global **COVID-19 data** to analyze trends in infections, deaths, and vaccinations across countries and continents.  
The goal is to practice **data exploration and transformation using SQL** while uncovering patterns about the pandemic’s global impact.

This analysis is inspired by the **Alex The Analyst SQL Portfolio Project**, with queries executed on the **COVID-19 dataset** from *Our World in Data*.

---

## 🧠 Objectives
- Explore and clean COVID-19 data for meaningful insights  
- Compare **total cases vs deaths** to find death likelihood  
- Analyze **infection rate vs population** by country  
- Identify **regions with highest infection and death rates**  
- Explore **vaccination progress** and calculate vaccination percentages  
- Practice SQL concepts such as **CTEs**, **temp tables**, and **views**

---

## 💾 Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project comes from:  
📊 [Our World in Data – COVID-19 Dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)

It contains daily global records of:
- Cases  
- Deaths  
- Population  
- Vaccination data  

The dataset is publicly available for educational and analytical purposes.

## 🧩 Key SQL Concepts Used
- **Filtering & Ordering**
- **Aggregation (SUM, MAX, GROUP BY)**
- **Joins** between deaths and vaccination tables  
- **Common Table Expressions (CTE)**
- **Temporary Tables**
- **Views** for visualization preparation
- **Window Functions (OVER PARTITION BY)** for running totals

## 📈 Insights
- 🌏 Indonesia’s death percentage fluctuates but shows consistent improvement after vaccination rollout.
- 📉 Countries with high population density tend to have higher infection rates.
- ⚰️ Europe recorded the highest total death count among all continents.
- 💉 The vaccination data shows a strong upward rolling trend  confirming effective distribution in several regions.
- 📊 Combining infections, deaths, and vaccinations provides a holistic view of pandemic control efficiency.
